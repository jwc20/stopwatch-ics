## Features

- Stopwatch with split functionality
- Dark mode
- Editable labels for each split intervals
- Caching/persistent data (you don't lose your data when the page is refreshed)
- Export to .ics files compatible for Mac, Windows, and Google Calendar apps

## Features to add

- Countdown("Pomodoro") feature
    - (Note) A stronger alternative would be to have a feature to create a time-block schedule and have a countdown timer running going through each time-block.
